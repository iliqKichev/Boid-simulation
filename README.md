# Boid Simulation

This is my first attempt at simulating swarm inteligence. The idea for the project came a over a year ago when I saw a video of Sebastian Lague. Further inspiration is drawn from the implementation presented at Ben Eater's site. Boid is a concept created by Craig Reynolds in 1987
